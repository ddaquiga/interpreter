# X Interpreter/Debugger

To run the interpreter use the following command:

	java -jar interpreter.jar < filename.x.cod >

To run in debugger mode use the following command:

	java -jar interpreter.jar -d <filename>

I included the following files to use on the compiler:

	factorial.x, fib.x, and their corresponding .cod files


In this project, I developed an interpreter and debugger which runs programs written in a made up language, X.
